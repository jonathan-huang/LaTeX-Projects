For the 2025 SURF program, I will be conducting research on a model of atomic spin called the co-quantum dynamics (CQD) theory, as proposed in Ref. \hyperref[sec:ref]{\textcolor{blue}{[1]}}. The model is currently used to model a multi-stage Stern-Gerlach experiment, with spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ atoms. This research project will try to extend the model to accommodate atoms of higher electron spin.
