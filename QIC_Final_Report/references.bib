ABSTRACT={<p>Qudit is a multi-level computational unit alternative to the conventional 2-level qubit. Compared to qubit, qudit provides a larger state space to store and process information, and thus can provide reduction of the circuit complexity, simplification of the experimental setup and enhancement of the algorithm efficiency. This review provides an overview of qudit-based quantum computing covering a variety of topics ranging from circuit building, algorithm design, to experimental methods. We first discuss the qudit gate universality and a variety of qudit gates including the pi/8 gate, the SWAP gate, and the multi-level controlled-gate. We then present the qudit version of several representative quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the phase estimation algorithm. Finally we discuss various physical realizations for qudit computation such as the photonic platform, iron trap, and nuclear magnetic resonance.</p>}

ABSTRACT = {Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) has the potential to revolutionize the area of quantum computing. QRAM uses quantum computing principles to store and modify quantum or classical data efficiently, greatly accelerating a wide range of computer processes. Despite its importance, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that cover the entire spectrum of QRAM architectures. We fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of QRAM, emphasizing its significance and viability in existing noisy quantum computers. By drawing comparisons with conventional RAM for ease of understanding, this survey clarifies the fundamental ideas and actions of QRAM. QRAM provides an exponential time advantage compared to its classical counterpart by reading and writing all data at once, which is achieved owing to storage of data in a superposition of states. Overall, we compare six different QRAM technologies in terms of their structure and workings, circuit width and depth, unique qualities, practical implementation, and drawbacks. In general, with the exception of trainable machine learning-based QRAMs, we observe that QRAM has exponential depth/width requirements in terms of the number of qubits/qudits and that most QRAM implementations are practical for superconducting and trapped-ion qubit systems.},
