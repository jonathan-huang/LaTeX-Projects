\bibitem{Bosdriesz2015RibosomeTuning}
E.~Bosdriesz, D.~Molenaar, B.~Teusink, and F.~J. Bruggeman, ``How fast-growing bacteria robustly tune their ribosome concentration to approximate growth-rate maximization,'' \emph{FEBS Journal}, vol. 282, no.~10, pp. 2029--2044, 2015.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent Bosdriesz et al. develop a coarse-grained kinetic model for E. coli that links ppGpp-mediated regulation of ribosome synthesis to near-optimal growth across conditions. They show that the native control logic keeps ribosomes saturated with charged tRNAs, preventing costly overproduction of ribosomal proteins and reallocating proteome to other growth-promoting enzymes; in this scheme, the fraction of inactive ribosomes acts as an intracellular signal of nutrient status. The model demonstrates that basic biochemical interactions are sufficient to achieve robust protein partitioning and growth-rate maximization, offering a mechanistic basis for bacterial “growth laws.” \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent Erickson et al. develop a top-down, parameter-free kinetic model that extends coarse-grained proteome allocation theory from steady state to transients and shows that a single flux-controlled resource-allocation strategy can predict how E. coli reprograms gene expression and biomass accumulation during nutrient upshifts and downshifts (including diauxic shifts). Using only qualitative regulatory knowledge plus a flux-balance constraint, the model quantitatively captures the time courses of ribosomal and catabolic sectors without adjustable kinetic parameters and explains why cells often recover suboptimally after shifts: protein-synthesis resources are reallocated according to a rigid global rule rather than to relieve specific bottlenecks. Quantitative proteomics validates the predicted trajectories, pointing to a general framework for describing growth-transition kinetics without detailed biochemical rate constants. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent The authors synthesize candidate mechanisms for maintaining "microdiversity," covering niche-based processes (e.g., resource partitioning and cross-feeding), neutral processes (e.g., migration and drift), and evolutionary processes (e.g., horizontal gene transfer). \end{quotation}

X.-P. Hu and M.~J. Lercher, ``An optimal growth law for rna composition and its partial implementation through ribosomal and trna gene locations in bacterial genomes,'' \emph{PLOS Genetics}, vol.~17, no.~11, p. e1009939, 2021.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent The paper derives a growth law for bacterial RNA composition by minimizing the combined mass of ribosomes (rRNA) and ternary complexes (largely EF-Tu-GTP-tRNA) at a required protein production rate. They predict that the optimal tRNA/rRNA ratio decreases monotonically with growth rate, which matches measurements across E. coli and other fast-growing microbes. The authors further show that genomes may help realize this law, since in many bacteria, rRNA operons are positioned closer to the replication origin than tRNA genes, so replication-associated effects drive lower tRNA/rRNA expression ratios at higher growth. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent They formulate a coarse-grained resource allocation model with nitrogen and carbon pathways, describing the effects of the uptake of sugars, and amino acids on the resource allocation towards proteome sectors that maximize the growth rate. It recovers cellular growth laws including the Monod law and the ribosomal growth law. They also find linear correlation between ribosome fraction and the abundance of amino acid equivalents, supporting the view that regulation of translational gene expression can enable cells to achieve an approximately optimal growth state. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent extend MacArthur's consumer–resource framework by embedding proteome-allocation constraints, creating a "consumer-proteome-resource" model in which species must divide limited protein-synthesis capacity between nutrient uptake and growth. Analytically and numerically, they derive coexistence conditions for many species and resources, showing how time-varying, resource-specific proteome budgeting shapes dynamics. The work links intracellular resource allocation to community-level outcomes and offers tractable criteria to predict when competitors can stably coexist. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent First modern formulation of the three-sector proteome partiton model. A phenomenological framework showing that bacterial growth rate and gene expression are tightly coupled by global resource-allocation constraints, especially the share of the proteome devoted to ribosomes. By perturbing E. coli with translation-inhibiting antibiotics and by forcing gratuitous protein expression, they derive and validate simple "growth laws" that quantitatively predict how changes in one dimension (e.g., burdening expression) feed back on the other (cell proliferation) and vice versa. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent Klumpp et al. show that a physical transport limit, which is the slow diffusion of ternary complexes in the crowded cytoplasm, constrains translatoinal throughput, and thus bacterial growth. They build a proteome-allocation model coupling ribosome abundance, ternary-complex diffusion, and macromolecular crowding, which predicts an optimal ribosomal fraction and quantitatively accounts for growth-rate-dependent translation speeds and allocation trends. This study reframes growth limits as being diffusion-controlled rather than purely enzymatic-kinetic \end{quotation}

Using a reduced metabolic model, they show how this additional constraint reshapes optimal allocation and growth predictions, showing interactions between metabolism and molecular crowding. \end{quotation}
