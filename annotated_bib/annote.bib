    abstract = {In rapidly growing bacteria, one-third of the proteins are ribosomal proteins and another one-sixth are ternary complexes (TCs) that bring amino acids to the ribosomes, making TCs the most abundant protein species. This study reveals that this very high TC content is forced upon the cell due to the slow diffusion of the large TCs in the crowded cytoplasm. A model is presented to describe how a bacterial cell solves the problem of proteomic resource allocation, balancing the two requirements for many ribosomes and for rapid translation. The model shows that proportional or approximately proportional synthesis of ribosomal proteins and TCs, as observed in Escherichia coli cells, is a near-optimal allocation scheme. Bacterial growth is crucially dependent on protein synthesis and thus on the cellular abundance of ribosomes and related proteins. Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

Using only qualitative regulatory knowledge plus a flux-balance constraint, the model quantitatively captures the time courses of ribosomal and catabolic sectors without adjustable kinetic parameters and explains why cells often recover suboptimally after shifts: protein-synthesis resources are reallocated according to a rigid global rule rather than to relieve specific bottlenecks. Quantitative proteomics validates the predicted trajectories, pointing to a general framework for describing growth-transition kinetics without detailed biochemical rate constants.}

abstract = {Abstract Bacteria must constantly adapt their growth to changes in nutrient availability; yet despite large‐scale changes in protein expression associated with sensing, adaptation, and processing different environmental nutrients, simple growth laws connect the ribosome abundance and the growth rate. Here, we investigate the origin of these growth laws by analyzing the features of ribosomal regulation that coordinate proteome‐wide expression changes with cell growth in a variety of nutrient conditions in the model organism Escherichia coli. We identify supply‐driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation. The study highlights the interplay between phenomenological modeling and molecular mechanisms in uncovering fundamental operating constraints, with implications for endogenous and synthetic design of microorganisms.},
