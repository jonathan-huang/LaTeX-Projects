    annote = {Lin et al. proposes a general theoretical framework that explains how exponential growth emerges in complex nonlinear reaction networks by combining two central principles: scalability of flux functions and ergodicity of the rescaled system dynamics. Although many biological networks are highly nonlinear, under the condition of scalability and ergodicity, they will exhibit either a well-defined exponential growth rate or periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic growth.}

Gunawardena formalizes reaction networks, and, using linear-algebraic tools and Perron-Frobenius theory, he develops the pathway to the deficiency-zero theorem, thus establishing conditions for existence, uniqueness, and local asymptotic stability of equilibria. Weak reversibility, terminal strong linkage classes, and examples illustrating when deficiency one admits multistationarity are also discussed. The notes emphasize how much of the nonlinear mass-action dynamics is constrained by hidden linear structure, making CRNT a powerful qualitative tool even without precise kinetic parameters.}

In monotone networks, trajectories are order-preserving, ruling out stable oscillations and chaos and enabling powerful decomposition results for large systems. The paper also show how small violations of monotonicity can still yield tractable behaviors, including multistability via positive feedback and robust adaptation motifs. The review synthesizes graph-theoretic criteria and examples from gene regulation to provide a practical toolkit for reasoning about stability and bistability in complex biochemical networks.}

    annote  = {This paper proves global convergence results for mass-action systems that are complex balanced: for any stoichiometric compatibility class, the omega-limit set of a trajectory consists either of a unique positive complex-balanced equilibrium or of boundary complex-balanced equilibria. The theorem is applied to several enzymatic mechanisms, establishing global asymptotic stability of their interior equilibria. The work extends classical detailed-balance results to the broader complex-balanced class, giving powerful structural criteria for global dynamics without parameter tuning.}
