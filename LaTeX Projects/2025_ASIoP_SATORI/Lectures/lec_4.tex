\subsection{Graph Attention Networks}
Graoh Attention Networks (GANs) work by sending the ? into an attention function. 

\section{Summary}
Graph neural networks are very general and powerful frameworks for machine learning. For example, not only is convolutional neural networks a special case of a GNN, an LLM is also a special case of a GNN. This fact is seen by
