\subsection{Research Problems}

Extending the CQD model to higher-spin systems could provide deeper insights into quantum measurement processes. This research aims to explore the feasibility of generalizing CQD theory to higher-spin atoms. To achieve this, we will conduct the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify relevant experimental data on higher-spin atomic systems.
    \item Develop theoretical models for atoms with higher spins and simulate their dynamics.
\end{enumerate}

By addressing these objectives, this study seeks to refine the theoretical foundation of CQD and expand its applicability to a broader range of quantum systems.

\subsection{Significance of Research}

Co-quantum dynamics theory has provided good results in predicting the result of the Frisch-Segr\`e experiment, which, as a multi-stage Stern-Gerlach experiment, is of great importance in quantum mechanical development. What is even better is the lack of fitting parameters, showing that this model agrees with quantum-mechanical calculations. Extending the model to possibly accommodate atoms of higher spins may provide a new perspective for understanding atomic spin.
