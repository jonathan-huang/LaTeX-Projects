    annote  = {Hui et al. use quantitative mass-spectrometry across controlled carbon, anabolic, and ribosomal limitations in E. coli to show that the proteome partitions into coarse-grained sectors whose mass fractions vary linearly with growth rate. Roughly half of the proteome follows these growth-rate–dependent trends, which are captured by a minimal flux model with only two effective parameters, linking proteome partitioning tightly to metabolic throughput. The results reveal a simple, global resource-allocation strategy underpinning complex gene-expression responses and provide a phenomenological framework for predicting cellular physiology without detailed molecular regulation, with implications for systems biology and synthetic circuit design.}

Using chemostat and batch experiments, they show that this relation holds robustly.}

Compared with E. coli, the ribosomal sector is smaller, consistent with a lower maximal growth rate in cyanobacteria. Light limitation reshapes multiple sectors strongly, whereas Ci limitation has a weaker impact; notably, carbon-assimilation proteins track light more than external Ci.}
