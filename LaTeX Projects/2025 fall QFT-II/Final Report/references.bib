abstract = {We review the field theory approach to percolation processes. Specifically, we focus on the so-called simple and general epidemic processes that display continuous non-equilibrium active to absorbing state phase transitions whose asymptotic features are governed, respectively, by the directed (DP) and dynamic isotropic percolation (dIP) universality classes. We discuss the construction of a field theory representation for these Markovian stochastic processes based on fundamental phenomenological considerations, as well as from a specific microscopic reaction-diffusion model realization. Subsequently we explain how dynamic renormalization group (RG) methods can be applied to obtain the universal properties near the critical point in an expansion about the upper critical dimensions dc=4 (DP) and 6 (dIP). We provide a detailed overview of results for critical exponents, scaling functions, crossover phenomena, finite-size scaling, and also briefly comment on the influence of long-range spreading, the presence of a boundary, multispecies generalizations, coupling of the order parameter to other conserved modes, and quenched disorder.}

ABSTRACT = {Climate change is generally having a negative impact on forest health by inducing drought stress and favouring the spread of pest species, such as bark beetles. The terrestrial monitoring of bark beetle infestation is very time-consuming, especially in the early stages, and therefore not feasible for extensive areas, emphasising the need for a comprehensive approach based on remote sensing. Although numerous studies have researched the use of optical data for this task, radar data remains comparatively underexplored. Therefore, this study uses the weekly and cloud-free acquisitions of Sentinel-1 in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Time series analysis within a Multi-SAR framework using Random Forest enables the monitoring of moisture content loss and, consequently, the assessment of tree vitality, which is crucial for the detection of stress conditions conducive to bark beetle outbreaks. High accuracies are achieved in predicting future bark beetle infestation (R2 of 0.83–0.89). These results demonstrate that forest vitality trends ranging from healthy to bark beetle-affected states can be mapped, supporting early intervention strategies. The standard deviation of 0.44 to 0.76 years indicates that the model deviates on average by half a year, mainly due to the uncertainty in the reference data. This temporal uncertainty is acceptable, as half a year provides a sufficient window to identify stressed forest areas and implement targeted management actions before bark beetle damage occurs. The successful application of this technique to extensive test sites in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia proves its transferability. For the first time, the results clearly demonstrate the expected relationship between radar backscatter expressed in the Kennaugh elements K0 and K1 and bark beetle infestation, thereby providing an opportunity for the continuous and cost-effective monitoring of forest health from space.},
